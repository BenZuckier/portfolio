# Ben Zuckier Portfolio

Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. 

This is the landing page/repo where you can find some projects I've worked on scholastically and in my free time. 

Enjoy :)

## Links

Here are links and brief summaries of my projects in some particular order.

- [Twitter](twitter/) NLP sentiment analysis disaster prediction.
  - Uses sentiment analysis NLP techniques to determine if a given Tweet is about a disaster (or if it's satire/hyperbole) from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/) competition. Deep Neural Network model hosted in the cloud, with a static client-side interface in Vue.JS!
- [Fraud](fraud/) model, cloud productionization, and demo. 
  - Explore and detect fraud on credit card data from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection/overview) competition.
- [Rossman](rossman/) regression model, and cloud pipeline deep dive.
  - Predict the sales numbers for Rossman drug stores from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rossmann-store-sales/overview) competition. This is mostly a deep dive on ML Ops cloud infrastructure and pipelines.
- [URL Shortener Website](shrtnr) using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Bootswatch frontend for nice and easy styling.
  - Website similar to bit.ly or other URL shortener services. Takes in a URL and returns a short URL. Can also do short-URL lookup to retrieve the full URL text without redirecting (good for security checks). Deployed with Google App Engine in the cloud.
- [Physics Capstone Project](phys/capstone)
  - Measured gravity using a massive pendulum whose period was measured with a laser, accurate to 1% and precise to .04% of actual "g".
- [Network Science Assignments](phys/networks/assignments)
  - A few assignments from Network Science I and II (Networks in the graph theory sense). The assignments are very complex and required a lot of analysis and programming using Wolfram Mathematica and Python.
